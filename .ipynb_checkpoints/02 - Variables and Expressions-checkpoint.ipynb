    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module we will discuss variables and expressions. These two topics--storing and manipulating information in applications--serve as the foundation for all other programming knowledge. We will begin by discussing the concept of variables and how they are represented in programming languages. Next, we turn to expressions, which are the means by which variables are manipulated within an application. We close this module by combining these concepts into statements. Statements are individual declarative statements which make up a program."

    "# Expressions\n",
    "An expression is a combination of operands (i.e., values, variables) and operands (i.e., +, -). Python evaluates expressions to produce some output. Just as mathematical expressions (e.g., 2 is the ouptput value of the expressions 1 + 1), expressions in Python generate some output that can be used in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Values and Types\n",
    "**What are the two properties of a variable?** Variables have values (e.g., 9, ‘Hello World’, 3.14159) and those values are of a particular type (e.g., character and numeric). Both the value and type of a variable is set when the variable is defined in your program. The type of the variable determines how Python treats the variable and how the variable can be used. The type of a variable is immutable and determined by the value so type can only be changed if the variable is redefined. The value references information that the program need to complete its tasks. Values can and do change frequently."

    "## Operators and Operands\n",
    "**How do variables interrelate?** Variables can be combined or compared (more on comparisons here: [Conditional Execution](03%20-%20Conditional%20Execution.ipynb)). You can only combine variables that have the same type. Python does not know how to join strings and numbers (you probably don't either), and it returns a syntax error message stating as much (i.e., can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an operator and what do operands do?** Operators are the building blocks of expressions in that they combine variables or values to perform some task. The operator instructs the Python interpreter on how to combine or assess the operands. The most common operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ** (exponential). All of these operands combine operators in some unique way. There are other operands that assess the relationship among operators and these are called conditional operands. The less than (<) and greater than (>) operators are examples of conditional operators. For more information on conditional operators, see [Conditional Execution](04%20-%20Conditional%20Execution.ipynb)."

    "# Variables\n",
    "**What is a variable, what do they do and why are they needed?** Variables are virtual storage locations for data elements in an application. The content of a variable is stored in the computer’s memory and the variable name serves as a pointer to the memory location so that your application can reliably retrieve the data at any point during execution. Just as you might use your fingers to keep track of how many times you've done something, you would use a variable to keep track of important information so that your application can perform its task successfully (e.g., if someone asks you to tap your foot 8 times, you can use your fingers to keep track of how many times you have tapped your foot so you know when to stop). You can think of a variable as storage bin in the attic and the variable name as the label that you put on the outside of the bin. While storage bins store our things, variables store our data and they make programming much more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Names and Keywords\n",
    "**What is and what is not allowed for variable names; what practices are discouraged/encouraged?** Variable names must be at least one character long and must start with a character (no numbers or special characters). Variable names *can* contain numbers and some special characters as long as they start with a character, but these practices are generally discouraged. Capitalization matters for variables so ‘welcomevariable’, ‘WelcomeVariable’ and ‘welcomeVariable’ are not interchangeable and would represent three different variables. The captialization in the final example (i.e., welcomeVariable) is called a camel-cased, and this technique is widely used as a best practice for variable naming. Variable names may not contain spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing Variable Names\n",
    "**What is a good variable name?** Just like putting descriptive labels on a storage bins or moving boxes, you should put a descriptive label on your variables. You could name them ‘x’, ‘y’, or ‘z’, but these names aren’t very descriptive. It is helpful to know that the box labled ‘pictures’ is a box full of pictures, and it is is similarly helpful to know that the variable graduationYear is likely a 4 digit number. See the statements section below for more examples of assigning variable names."
