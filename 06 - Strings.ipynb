    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module, we will expand on the earlier module on variables and introduce the string variable type. Though more accurately described as a data structure, the string data type has many features that are not found in numeric values. To understand these issues, we begin by defining a string as a data structure, and from there discuss how the data in strings are structure. We then discuss the properties and methods that are associated with string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strings\n",
    "Though data elements are often thought of as numbers or strings, the appropriate distinction is numbers in characters. So, strings are not a data element, but are instead a data structure. Specifically, a string is a data structure that contains an ordered collection of characters and has properties and methods that are unique to the string object. In this chapter, we will look at the structure of a string, the content of a string and the methods and properties that are accessible through the string object. \n",
