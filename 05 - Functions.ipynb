    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module, we will learn about functions--what they are and why they are useful--and how to incorporate them into our applications. We begin with an abstract discussion of what and why of functions. Then we will discuss the different kinds of functions we encounter in Python. We close this module by looking at some useful built-in and user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions\n",
    "A function is a named sequence of statements that performs some programmatic task. Functions extend the functionality of python by packaging a series of statements as flexible, reusable blocks of code. Though the usefulness of functions is difficult to see, functions have several important advantages: 1) functions make your program easier to read, understand, and debug; 2) functions make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code; 3) functions increase the reusability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in and user-defined functions. These functions are called and they may accept input parameters (i.e., values the functions need to do whatever it is they do) and may have a return values (i.e., the function may produce some value in the code). Input parameters are values that are passed into the function. When variables are passed into a as an argument is copied to a new variable that is temporarily created for use in the function (this copy is called a local variable, meaning that it is local to the function and any changes to it are confined to the local function and do not affect the original variable). Functions may return a value to the calling program. This is called the return value. When a value is returned, the function ends and the return value becomes accessible in the calling program/function (note: functions can call other functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in Functions\n",
    "Python has many built-in functions that are either included in the base language or are accessible via libraries. Some common functions are listed below. Others can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html"

Also, like variables, functions can take on any name you want, but you will need to avoid reserved words and built-in functions. \n",
