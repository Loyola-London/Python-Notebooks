    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module we will discuss issues related to the flow of an application. When writing an application to perform some task, your application will often need to respond to changing conditions and navigate to successful completion. This is handled through conditional statements which direct the execution of your application according to the current state of the world. We use these statements frequently in our own life--'if' the store is out of whole milk, buy skim milk. 'Else', buy whole milk--but we rarely think about how they are structured and how different conditions result in different choices. In this module we will learn how to be explicit as we direct the flow of our applications.\n",

    "# Conditional Execution\n",
    "Conditional execution occurs when values are joined by conditional (or comparison) operators. Together, these values and operators form a conditional statement which evaluates as a true or false value. These concepts are further discussed below.\n",

    "**Note:** Python is very strict about indentation. Though indentation refers to any leading white-space, it is a best practice to use tabs to indent your code. Indents are used to create levels of execution where consecutive lines at the same level of execution are executed together. Execution is broken when the interpreter encounters a line at a different level of indentation. So, when you create a conditional block of code, all of the code you want to execute if the condition is true must be indented to the same level. Because the two print statements are indented to the same level, Python interprets that to mean that you want both lines executed if the conditional statement is true.\n",

Asking the user for input is complicated by two issues: 1) we have little control over what they type 2) regardless of what they type it will be treated as a string. This means that if we are hoping for a number, even if they give us what we want, we have to convert it from a string to a number. If they don’t give us what we want, the conversion step will raise an error as our application struggles to understand their response. Try blocks are used to suppress and handle these types of errors. Just as with if blocks, indented code blocks are executed only if the condition is met.
