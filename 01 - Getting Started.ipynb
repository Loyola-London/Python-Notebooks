    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module we will cover some basics of programming and set up our programming environment. We begin with a brief introduction to programming, including some reasons why programming is important today and an overview of concepts that are common to all programming languages. Next we will walk through the steps for installing Python 3, the version of Python we will use throughout the semester. Once Python is installed, we will install Pycharm, an integrated development environment (IDE) that we will use to compose all of the applications we write over the course of the semester. We will close this module with a discussion of Jupyter Notebooks, the tool we will use for class notes."

    "# Why Program?\n",
    "1. Everyone needs to learn to program – There is a synergy between computers and humans in that the kinds of problems computers are good at are the kinds of problems humans are particularly bad at. We get bored; computers don’t. We forget our place or the count; computers don’t.\n",
    "2. Creativity – programming is the language of computing. If you want to be fluent and capable in a computing environment, you must learn how to speak the language. Additionally, knowing how to program gives you new outlets for problem solving. Ultimately, the goal of this class is not to produce professional developers but to give you a foundation for solving problems in a computing/information/communication environment."

    "# Programming Concepts\n",
    "1. **Reserved words** – reserved words are words that only have one meaning in Python. If you try to use those words for any other purpose or in an unintended way, you will run into errors (syntax or logical). These words have special meaning and are useful for developing advanced programs in Python.\n",
    "2. **Compiler vs. Interpreter** – What is the difference between compilers and interpreters and what are the advantages/disadvantages of both? A compiler turns application code into machine-specific language. Compiled programs will only run on one type of system and must be specifically compiled to run on different types of systems. Interpreters are compiled programs (so the interpreter must be compiled to run on your system) which translate application code into machine-specific language. Compiled programs tend to be more powerful and/or efficient while interpreted programs tend to be more flexible and portable.\n",
    "3. **Errors** – You will run into a lot of errors. What are the three types of errors you will experience in programming and how do they differ? They typically fall into one of three categories (the book uses 3 different categories, know mine).\n",
    "    * *Syntax* – Syntax errors are the least dangerous, but most frustrating. They are less dangerous because they prevent the application from running. In this way, you are protected from the error, but your application either does not run at all or will crash at specific locations in the code. They can be difficult to root out because they may propagate through several layers of code (called a traceback).\n",
    "    * *Logical* – Logical errors are slightly more dangerous because the application will run without problem; however, it will process the inputs incorrectly. An example of a logical error would be forgetting to include parentheses in a calculation. The parentheses force the order of operation and ensure a correct process. If you leave them out, Python may follow different steps in calculating a solution. These can be very easy to spot (you are not getting the correct output) but very difficult to find (but you don’t know why).\n",
    "    * *Design* – Design errors are the most dangerous because the program runs well and executes exactly as you would hope. However, your design of the program is incorrect because you did not understand the problem. You may have coded the application appropriately according to your understanding, but your understanding is deficient. These errors are very difficult to identify and can be catastrophic. \n"
