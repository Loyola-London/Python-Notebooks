Up to this point, we have been using rather simple structures for storing data in our applications such as numbers, characters and more recently strings. As you write more complex applications you will find yourself needing to keep track of increasingly complex data. Python has several data structures that will help with these tasks, and we will be looking specifically at lists in this module.\n",

If we use del and the name of our list, it will delete the entire list. If we use an index value, it will delete the element at that index.
