    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module, we explore new ways of acquiring data in our application. Up to this point, we have been using data values that are either entered by the user or are persistent in our programs. This limits the types of tasks our applications can handle. In this chapter we will learn how to use python to interface with external files. We will learn how to open files, read files line-by-line and write data to new or existing files. \n",

    "# Files \n",
    "## Opening Files\n",
    "Because python is an interpreted language, interfacing with the operating system is handled by the interpreter. Therefore, when files are ‘opened’ python requests a file handler that acts as a middleman between python and the file. If you think of it from an ownership perspective, python owns the commands in python and the operating system owns the files stored on the computer. Neither really understands how to interact with one-another, so a middleman is needed to translate python’s requests into directions the operating system understands. "

    "The **with** keyword above provides a safe way of working with files because files must be opened and closed to ensure data integrity. If your code crashes after you open the file, the file may be left open and may be corrupted. The with statement ensures that files are closed when the with block of code completes. For indentation purposes, code that needs access to the file handler should be indented one level beyond the indentation level of the with (just like conditional and iteration blocks).  \n",

Be careful with the ‘w’ option because it will erase the content of the file if the file already exists. Otherwise, it will create the file. Also note the use of the str() method when writing to our file. Python can only write strings so any attempt to write an integer will result in a type conflict error. Finally, I append the newline character to the end of each line. This forces each number to a newline in our file.
